# Creating A Ticket

It's important to provide as much relevant information as possible. This will help Support resolve the issue quickly.

## Reproducing the Issue

If the issue can be replicated it's best to detail the preicse steps for Support to reproduce.

1. Steps To Reproduce
2. Actual Results
3. Expected Results

## Ticket Guidelines

The issue's reproductions steps are often not clear. In this case here's a guideline checklist to consider:

1. Versions

What version is this issue occuring on? Is the [image version](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032964072-9-3-19-Services-Updates-2019-36-1) up to date? If not maybe the issue is [resolved in a later version](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002905752-Platform-Changelog)

For CLI issues try running `lcp version` and provide us with that. For issues with a service provide the image versions `liferaycloud/backup:3.2.1` or more preferably provide us with the `gradle.properties` file itself.

2. Logs

Download and provide the logs of the service on the relevant container. ![](../../images/logs-web-console.png)

3. Support Access

Before opening a ticket make sure [support access](/docs/-/knowledge_base/dxp-cloud/support) is enabled.
